Description
Your job is to create a simple password validation function, as seen on many websites.

The rules for a valid password are as follows:

There needs to be at least 1 uppercase letter.
There needs to be at least 1 lowercase letter.
There needs to be at least 1 number.
The password needs to be at least 8 characters long.
You are permitted to use any methods to validate the password.

Examples:
password("Abcd1234"); ===> true
password("Abcd123"); ===> false
password("abcd1234"); ===> false
password("AbcdefGhijKlmnopQRsTuvwxyZ1234567890"); ===> true
password("ABCD1234"); ===> false
password("Ab1!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<,"); ===> true;
password("!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\:;?/>.<,"); ===> false;

def password(st):
        while any(char.isupper() for char in st) and any(char.islower() for char in st) and any(char.isdigit() for char in st) and len(st) >= 8:
            return True
        return False    
print(password(st="ABCD1234"))
